# LOSA_Corr_to_Higher_Spherical_Harmonic_Modes
In this repo, I will store the method and results of the LOSA correction to the leading (2, 2) and higher spherical harmonic modes (3, 3) , (4, 4) ..etc.

## Here I will check that higer modes can mimic LOSA as follows:

|Model  | Signal| Outcome |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
|No HM + Non-zero LOSA| HM + Zero LOSA| Fitting-factor peaks for \|LOSA\| $\neq$ 0 |
|HM + Non-zero LOSA| HM + Zero LOSA| FF peaks for \|LOSA\| = 0|
|HM + Non-zero LOSA| HM + Non-zero LOSA| FF peaks for \|LOSA\| $\neq$ 0|
